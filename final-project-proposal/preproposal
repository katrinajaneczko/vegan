# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
  #Is It Vegan? - Website or app where someone can take a picture/uplaod a picture of a barcode of a food product and will be told whether the product is vegan (i.e. if it has any non-vegan ingredients) or not
    --> this is the one I am definitely leaning toward
  #InMyFeels - Mood tracker app for Android where someone tracks their mood/activities day-to-day and the app shows patterns through graphs/charts over weeks/months/years
  #Program that identifies a song that's playing (using SoundHound or Shazam API) then automatically puts it in a Spotify playlist
  #Program that will help my mom automate one of her computer tasks (she is a preschool teacher with little comfortability using computers)
  #SnapKeep - Program that automatically sends a Snapchat to someone when your streak with them is about to expire

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?
  #I plan to fly solo on this project

## Do you have any questions of your own?
  #Will I have enough time to learn everything I need for this project?
  #What are things I'll have to research in order to be successful? (I'm already making a list!)
  #If I use pieces of other people's code that I find on the internet (i.e. YouTube videos, blogs, StackExchange, GitHub etc), do I cite their work? If so, how?
