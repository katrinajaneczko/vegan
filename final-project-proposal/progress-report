Is It Vegan?

Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), 
be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have created a web app called Is It Vegan using Flask/Python, HTML, CSS, and SQLite that has the following pages: 
Index, Look Up, History, and About Veganism. The Index page gives an introduction to the web app, why it's useful, 
and how it works. Look Up allows a user to upload a picture of a barcode of a food product and then a program I wrote 
with Python/Flask/csv will read, decode, and extract information from the barcode including the name, brand, and ingredients. 
It will then display whether the product is vegan or not (if it isn't, then it'll also display the first detected offending ingredient) 
and also a modified version of the original image but with a green rectangle drawn around the detected barcode. 
The History page shows a log of past lookups along with a timestamp and relevant info. The About Veganism page gives information 
on what veganism is and some resources related to it. The site also has Registration, Login, and Logout features. To store all 
this information for each individual user, I used SQLite to create a database. The passwords get hashed before being stored and 
usernames cannot be repeated. Oh, and I also designed a cute little logo/icon for my site using Google Drawings!

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I must still finish making the website by adding pictures and just making it look nicer. Also, I want to make sure it can 
be viewed as a mobile version. I need to add code to my barcode reader program that tells it to ignore QR codes. I want to 
add specific error messages. I also want to see if I can improve/simplify the process of checking the ingredients list of the 
product against the nonvegan ingredients list, because right now it's pretty complicated and not straightforward.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Some barcodes, for example for very new products or for products that are not for individual sale or for products that are
only present in a local grocery store and nowhere else, do not appear in the barcode database I am using. So, I have an error 
message that is displayed to the user if their barcode isn't in the database. Additionally, if the barcode picture is too blurry 
or the lighting is too dark, it won't be able to be read (but that is expected). Another problem is that if their is a barcode and
a QR code in the same picture, the reader will show an error and be unable to tell which is the barcode it should be focusing on;
I still have to fix this.

I of course ran into many other problems as well, but with hours of googling, scouring StackExchange, YouTube, W3Schools, 
and lots and lots of trial and error, I was able to solve them. I plan to do the same for the other fixable problems I mentioned. 
Honestly, one of my biggest problems starting out was just a lack of knowledge. How do I know what to google if I don't even 
understand what I'm doing? This got very frustrating, but then I was able to figure it out. Now, I know more about how to use 
the terminal, install things using pip3, use VSCode, play around with Bootstrap and CSS, use SQL and Flask, sort through 
StackExchange posts, be more patient with my code when it isn't working, and more. These are huge steps in my learning that I'm very proud of.
